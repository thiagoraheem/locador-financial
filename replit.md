# Sistema Financeiro Locador

## Overview

This is a comprehensive financial management web application for the "Locador" system, built as a full-stack solution with FastAPI backend and React frontend. The system provides complete financial operations management including accounts payable/receivable, financial transactions, categories, and real-time dashboard analytics. It integrates with an existing SQL Server database and maintains compatibility with the current authentication system using SHA-256 password hashing and JWT tokens.
